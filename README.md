## Comment
- To run this program, it has to involve multiple clients (invitees). you cam run it on your local machine but just ensure you use the local IP address (127.0.0.1) when running it between two terminals. If running between two different computers, you should use your invitees/opponents IP Address in this case. By the way, this will schedule a meeting between multiple clients. It's a peer-to-peer network mdoel. And when the app is running each work done by the app runs on seperate thread this is to enable other people trying to schedule a meeting with you proceed with their actions.
